* Generate centroid of 1998 enumeration areas and spatial join to 2008 enumeration areas
* just to visualize:
SELECT id, AsText(PointOnSurface(geom)) AS pointText, district FROM pop1998

CREATE TABLE pop1998_pos AS

*Then vector -> geoprocessing -> intersection. So now it's a table. 
* pop1998_new2 is the result of the intersect between pop2008_aoi and pop1998_pos

*Aggregate population by district
select DISTRICT, sum(total_popu_2)
from pop1998_new2
group by DISTRICT

* There were some duplicated entries in mzuzu, checked others but they were fine
select sum(mzuzu_popu), sum(areacheck)
from mzuzu_unique
* Join 1998 and 2008

SELECT RecoverGeometryColumn ('mwPop2', 'geom', 4326, 'MULTIPOLYGON')

* copy over my table
create table mwPopProj as
select *

SELECT RecoverGeometryColumn ('mwPopProj', 'geom', 4326, 'MULTIPOLYGON')

* srid is in the system
select *

* Set the projection
select discardgeometrycolumn('mwPopProj', 'geom')
update mwPopProj set geom = transform(geom, 110004)
select recovergeometrycolumn('mwPopProj', 'geom', 110004, 'MULTIPOLYGON')

* calculate ellipsoidal and planar area
alter table mwPopProj add column areaEllip real
update mwPopProj set areaEllip = Area(geom, 1)/1000000

alter table mwPopProj add column areaPlanar real
update mwPopProj set areaPlanar = Area(geom)/1000000

* Calculate values
alter table mwPopChange add column density2008 float
update mwPopChange set density2008 = pop2008/areaPlanar

alter table mwPopChange add column density1998 float
update mwPopChange set density1998 = pop1998/areaPlanar

alter table mwPopChange add column popChange float
update mwPopChange set popChange = 10.0 * (pop2008-pop1998)/pop1998
